# Architecture overview

Ensemble is a self-organizing multiroom audio system. Every node runs the **same
single binary**. Nodes find each other automatically (mDNS + gossip), organize
into **groups**, and play audio in sync: the group **master** runs an audio
**source** that decodes media into timestamped PCM (or Opus); every member —
including the master itself — **subscribes** to that source and plays the stream
out through a clock-disciplined **sink**. A master-anchored clock plus a per-node
phase-lock servo keeps every speaker aligned.

The guiding constraint is **simple and basic**: one binary, four ports, no
external services, no database, no PKI. State is replicated by gossip; everything
heals itself.

This section is the topic-by-topic architecture reference. Read this page for the
model, then dive into the subpage for the part you care about:

| Subpage | What it covers |
|---|---|
| [Discovery & cluster](discovery-and-cluster.md) | node identity, ports, mDNS, gossip, the replicated document, groups (follow / takeover / self-heal) |
| [Wire protocol](wire-protocol.md) | the framed packet format, packet types, UDP/TCP transport, FEC, codec negotiation, protocol versioning |
| [Clock sync](clock-sync.md) | master-anchored NTP-style clock follower |
| [Media & streaming](media-and-streaming.md) | media sources, the audio source server, subscription, ring buffer, prime, restart |
| [Playout pipeline](playout-pipeline.md) | the sink: jitter buffer, fractional resampler, phase-lock servo, output backends |
| [Sequence diagrams](sequence-diagrams.md) | end-to-end flows: attach (join a group), play, detach (stop / leave / get lost) |
| [HTTP API & UI](api.md) | REST, WebSocket, the node proxy, the Svelte SPA |

For building a **player** (a receive-only node — Go daemon or ESP32 firmware), the
self-contained byte-level spec is [`developer/player-protocol.md`](../developer/player-protocol.md).

## The node model

A node is one process. It is identified by a **16-byte node ID** (32 hex chars),
generated on first start and immutable forever after. Everything else about a node
— name, volume, calibration, group membership — is mutable runtime state.

A node runs up to two independently-enableable **roles**:

- **room** (the `master` role) — gossips, owns its slice of the cluster state,
  serves the HTTP API + web UI, sources audio, and *drives* players.
- **player** (the `playback` role) — a receive-only participant that plays a
  group's audio in sync. It never gossips and holds no cluster state; a master
  discovers it over mDNS and drives it.

A node can be a room, a player, or both. "room" / "player" are the user-facing
names; the wire and CLI keep the original `master` / `playback` role names.

Every alive gossiping node always **masters its own group** (group ID == node ID),
even with no players attached. Group membership is *derived*, not stored — see
[Discovery & cluster](discovery-and-cluster.md).

### Producer and consumer, one control plane

The two roles are a clean **producer / consumer** split, with *no* "same-node"
special-casing:

- A **room (master)** is a pure **producer**. It **owns the clock** — it *is* the
  time authority, serving `monoNow()` and stamping the stream with that same clock,
  so it never *follows* a clock (it reads `monoNow()` directly for every PTS). It
  sources the stamped stream and runs a **driver** that turns cluster state + API
  actions into control-plane commands.
- A **player** is a pure **consumer**: a clock follower + stream subscriber + sink
  behind a control **listener**. It follows whatever clock/source endpoint the
  master hands it in an `ATTACH`, applies `SETVOL`/`SETDELAY`/`DETACH`, and reports
  `STATUS` back. It is driven *entirely* over the control plane.

A combined node runs **both** subsystems from one `main`, exactly as if `--role
master` and `--role playback` were two processes on the host — its own driver
drives its own player **over loopback**, identical to a remote player. Because
control (volume, channel, output delay) is a property of the *node*, not of
playback, the master asserts it whether or not the group is playing.

1. **Discovery** registers the node over mDNS and browses for peers; any peer not
   yet in the gossip cluster is joined.
2. **Cluster** is the memberlist gossip layer plus the single eventually-consistent
   replicated document (node records, group names, playback status). It also
   derives the live group topology from that document plus liveness.
3. **Group engine** acts on the derived topology: it handles follow/unfollow,
   master takeover, self-heal, and — when this node is a master serving a group —
   orchestrates playback sessions.
4. On **play**, the master opens a **media source** for the URI and runs a **source
   server**: it stamps each 20 ms frame with a master-clock presentation timestamp
   and fans it out to every subscriber.
5. Every **player** — a receive-only subsystem (clock follower + subscriber +
   **sink**: jitter buffer → resampler → gain → output device) — is driven over the
   **control plane**: the master's *driver* sends it `ATTACH`/`SETVOL`/`DETACH`
   (UDP), and it follows the master clock and plays. A master plays its *own*
   speakers by running this same player subsystem and driving it **over loopback** —
   identical to a remote player, no special case.
6. The **HTTP API**, WebSocket, node proxy and **SPA** are the control surface. The
   master *translates* every control action (assign, play, stop, volume, …) into
   the control-plane commands above — fired immediately on the state change, not on
   the soft-state re-assert tick.

## The two timing problems

Multiroom sync is two separate problems, and the design keeps them apart:

- **Phase** — *when* a chunk of audio reaches the speaker (cross-room alignment).
  Solved by stamping every frame with a master-clock PTS, sharing one master clock
  via the [clock follower](clock-sync.md), and scheduling playout against it.
- **Rate** — *how fast* audio is fed to the DAC. Each node's crystal runs at its
  own ~48 kHz (tens of ppm off), so left alone two speakers drift apart. Solved in
  the [playout pipeline](playout-pipeline.md): the DAC's blocking write paces the
  rate, and a phase-lock servo trims a fractional resampler to hold the play head
  on the master clock.

## Canonical audio format

Everything streams as **48 kHz, stereo, s16le** PCM in **20 ms frames** (960
samples/channel, 3840 bytes). Decoders convert to this; the sink always consumes
it. Each frame on the wire carries both a **`seq`** (frame counter — ordering, loss
detection, FEC block identity) and a **`pts`** (presentation timestamp in
master-clock nanoseconds — playout scheduling). See the [wire protocol](wire-protocol.md).

## Design philosophy

- **One universal binary.** Optional native libraries (libopus, libasound) are
  loaded at runtime via `dlopen` (purego) — no cgo, no build variants. A host
  without a library simply reports that capability off.
- **No leader, no consensus.** State is one document, merged last-writer-wins per
  record. Groups are derived from it; failover is just re-derivation after a node
  drops out of gossip.
- **Observed-by-construction networking.** Nodes prefer addresses they have
  actually seen traffic from; the audio path needs no address resolution at all —
  the source streams back to wherever each subscription came from.
- **Self-healing everywhere.** A node that disappears and returns rejoins its old
  group automatically; a subscriber that loses the stream re-primes; a wedged
  output device fails over to the next.

Seek, auth/TLS, internet-facing operation, playlists, album art/metadata, multiple
simultaneous streams per group, hardware mixer volume (volume is software gain in
v1). Per-group play/pause **is** supported.
