          "Audio is Opus-coded so each frame fits one small packet (no fragile IP fragmentation), and the master sends forward-error-correction parity alongside it, so most lost frames are rebuilt with no retransmit.

        solution:
          "One node is the time reference. Each player continuously measures its offset and round-trip to that master and translates “play at T” into its own local time, so the same frame lands at the same real-world instant on every speaker.",

          "Even with perfect timing, no two sound cards sample at exactly 48 kHz — a few parts-per-million apart, rooms slide out of phase over a long track.",
        solution:
          "A continuous rate servo watches how fast each DAC actually drains its buffer versus the master timeline and resamples by a micro-correction to match. Rooms stay phase-locked for hours, not just for the first minute.",
