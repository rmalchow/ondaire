// free-run at 1x, gently slew toward each heartbeat, and hard-snap only on a real
// discontinuity (track change, resume, or a large delta = seek/replay). This yields
// evenly-spaced 1 s ticks instead of the stall-then-catch-up sawtooth a naive
// "re-anchor every heartbeat" produces.

// without timers. PlaybackBar feeds it performance.now().
